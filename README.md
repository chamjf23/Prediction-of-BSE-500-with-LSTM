# Prediction-of-BSE-500-with-LSTM

For decades, investors relied on intuition and analysis of company news, history, and industry trends to make investment decisions. However, the vast amount of historical stock data available now makes it a perfect match for machine learning algorithms. While the idea of a perfectly predictable market seems far-fetched, major financial institutions are increasingly using complex models built by quantitative analysts. This shift is evident in the transformation of trading floors from loud, phone-wielding brokers to rows of machine learning experts quietly analyzing data. In fact, algorithms now handle a staggering 70% of all Wall Street trades. This project explores how Deep Learning models, particularly Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are being used to predict stock prices in this age of algorithms.
